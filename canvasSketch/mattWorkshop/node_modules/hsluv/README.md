# HSL<sub>uv</sub> - Human-friendly HSL

## Installation

Client-side: download [the latest hsluv.min.js](https://github.com/hsluv/hsluv/tree/master/javascript/dist).

Once this module is loaded in the browser, you can access it via the
global ``window.hsluv``.

Server-side: ``npm install hsluv``.

## Usage

Most functions take tuples, ie: Javascript arrays with three elements.  Make sure you are using
`func([a,b,c])` and not `func(a,b,c)`. If you are getting NaN for output then this is probably
the problem.

**hsluvToHex([hue, saturation, lightness])**

*hue* is a number between 0 and 360, *saturation* and *lightness* are
numbers between 0 and 100. This function returns the resulting color as
a hex string.

**hsluvToRgb([hue, saturation, lightness])**

Like above, but returns an array of 3 numbers between 0 and 1, for the
r, g, and b channel.

**hexToHsluv(hex)**

Takes a hex string and returns the HSLuv color as array that contains
the hue (0-360), saturation (0-100) and lightness (0-100) channel.
_Note:_ The result can have rounding errors. For example saturation can
be 100.00000000000007

**rgbToHsluv([red, green, blue])**

Like above, but *red*, *green* and *blue* are passed as numbers between
0 and 1.

Use **hpluvToHex**, **hpluvToRgb**, **hexToHpluv** and **rgbToHpluv** for
the pastel variant (HPLuv). Note that HPLuv does not contain all the colors
of RGB, so converting arbitrary RGB to it may generate invalid HPLuv colors.

For advance use cases, additional functions are avalible:

**hsluvToLch**, **lchToHsluv**

**hpluvToLch**, **lchToHpluv**

**rgbToXyz**, **xyzToRgb**

**rgbToLch**, **lchToRgb**

**luvToXyz**, **xyzToLuv**

**lchToLuv**, **luvToLch**
